## Setup (tested on Sonoma 14.3)
If you're using Anaconda, bring up a virtual environment (I used Python 3.8.18).

And setup your virtual environment using these steps https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/. 

You can install required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

Create a dedicated folder for your local vectorstore files using `mkdir vectorstore`.

## Running the application

Once you've gone through above setup, you should be able to run the application locally using `streamlit run app.py`.
